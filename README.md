Description of Task 4: Create Doxygen Documentation
In this task, I focused on creating comprehensive documentation for my code using Doxygen, a powerful tool for generating documentation from annotated source code. The following steps were carried out:

Adding Doxygen Comments: I meticulously added Doxygen-style comments to all public functions, classes, properties, and fields in my code. This involved using specific Doxygen tags such as @param, @return, and @brief to provide clear descriptions of the functionality and purpose of each component. These comments help users understand how to use the code effectively and provide insights into its structure.

Generating Documentation: After completing the comments, I utilized Doxygen to generate the documentation. I configured the Doxygen settings to specify the output format, which includes HTML and LaTeX, allowing for easy access and distribution. The generated documentation serves as a valuable resource for both current and future developers, enabling them to navigate the codebase and understand its functionalities with ease.

The result of this task is a well-documented codebase that meets the standards of clarity and accessibility, enhancing collaboration and maintenance in future development efforts.
